# lab for 24fall
Here are labs for cs61c_24fall. Each branch corresponds to the completion of a specific lab.
At the same time, here are the links to the repositories for the four projects:

1. [Project 1](https://github.com/YCChengit/cs61c_24all_proj1.git)
2. [Project 2](https://github.com/YCChengit/cs61c_24all_proj2.git)
3. [Project 3](https://github.com/YCChengit/cs61c_24all_proj3.git)
4. [Project 4](not finish) Sorry I can't use hive machine because I'm not a student in UCB...

So the journey of this course has to end now. I'm really happy to meet this course and Dan! I have learnt a lot from this course!
